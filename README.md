# D3-Challenge  
## Introduction  
This project demonstrates the use of D3 to generate a scatter plot on a web page.  The scatter plot includes the (0,0) point, the graph area is square, and the grid lines are included so that the user can visualise the relative spread of the data along the two axis and judge the significance of the dependence between the two variables. A muted light colour was selected for the data points and the state abbrevations written in black so that the text would be clear but not dominate the image.
